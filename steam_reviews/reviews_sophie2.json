So far, I really like the characters, and the map/environmental design is still top notch. The music, as always, is an absolute treat. The addition of the weather system is also neat, as it kinda makes it a puzzle to travel through the new zones since some paths open and close depending on what the weather is. The actual combat is also improved, as the 'tap in' system helps you use every character in your party whether it be for attacking or swapping in for a guard.\n\nPerformance could be better, it's a definite downgrade from Blue Reflection Tie and the Ryza games since those ran relatively flawlessly on my system, but isn't terrible since they actually have decent graphics settings to tweak (though the aliasing is particularly bad in this, and nothing I've tweaked has been able to mitigate it).\n\nOverall, highly recommended!", "positive": true}, {"review": "Fun", "positive": true}, {"review": "was ready to refund when I couldn't interact with the first barrel I came across, but then I actually could interact with the barrel in the atelier so it's all good\n\nsolid 10/10", "positive": true}, {"review": "Good game.\nI like Weather and Alchemy system.", "positive": true}, {"review": "kamige", "positive": true}, {"review": "Feels a little slow in the first half.

I wanted to play with mouse and keyboard but for some reason the game has a constant stutter unless a controller is plugged in. There were no frame drops, just some weird stutter every two seconds or so.  Once I connected my controller it was fixed, but then I ran into another issue. I got to a point in the conversation which had 4 options for inputs and wouldn't you know it? the button choices were all mouse and keyboard options. So I was forced into plugging in a controller only to see mouse and keyboard button options once I did, what?!?!? I tried to go into settings to see if I had to select a controller specifically only to find there was no way to set one way or another, both command lists were apparently constantly active? Why it was choosing mouse and keyboard with the controller connected I have no idea.", "positive": false}, {"review": "21 hours later and only about halfway through the story, so take this review with a grain of salt\n\nAltier Sophie is a very enjoyable game set after the events of the first game (obviously). Sophie now finds herself in a dream world that allows her to meet new characters and even a few surprise characters from the original game. That's about all I'll say about the story as that's all I cared to follow on it. \n\nBeing perfectly honest here, I haven't been that impressed with the Altier games stories. I don't know if it's the dialogue or the heavily recycled/cheap animation shortcuts they take, but I just can't get too invested in these characters or the story they're involved in.\n\nThankfully where Altier Sophie lacks in story, it makes up for in it's game play loop. You are an alchemist (again obviously) so you wander the maps in this game gathering up various resources to meld them all to create you're latest mad experiment, be it weapons, armor, explosives, cra... I MEAN medicine. As a gamer who hasn't played many games with this style of game play, I find it to be enjoyable, rewarding, and relaxing. My one sole critique with this one part of the game is the board that is used to combine the ingredients is very one note. there's no variation in the board itself so your not presented with much challenge outside of how to arrange the actual ingredients.\n\nThe combat of this game is also enjoyable in it's own right (take it from the guy who usually doesn't enjoy turn based combat) neat party swaps, fun animations, plus the option to speed up the combat speed to make grinding feel a little less tedious (thanks to whoever pitched that idea) Honestly I preferred the seamless combat in Altier Ryza, but this one is still good. The only downside is the difficulty spikes you encounter with each boss battle, you'll be going through the dungeon area and not even realize you're about to come up on a boss battle.  The other annoyance is that you can't flee to grind levels or get better geared for it.\n\nNot a super technical gamer, but the only trouble I've run into is the occasional PERSISTENT frame drops, makes the game feel choppy, but tends to go away after loading a new area. Which reminds me... the load times in this game are actually VERY QUICK. I know people expect nonexistent load times, but with how fast you can go from your cozy home to the current dungeon is a great touch.\n\nall and all, I give this game an 8/10, worth your time if you enjoy just a fun slice of life adventure. No huge complex plot (by JRPG standards) lots of quirky characters, fun game play loop, and a decent combat system. Plus plenty of cute potential waifus (again.... obviously)", "positive": true}, {"review": "Like the first game, but expands on existing mechanics and makes a lot of things better.", "positive": true}, {"review": "The original Sophie was what got me into the series, very happy to see her return. Few things I\u2019d like to mention. You no longer need to aimlessly search for a specific item; they did a great job with the world map which now displays all of the materials/monster that can be found corresponding to a single area. The combat returns to its classic turn-based system, it feels more comfortable and less hectic compared to Ryza. Your entire party can join in on the fight and there\u2019s also a double speed option. Love the new group, esp Ramizel and as always big wholesome vibes all round.", "positive": true}, {"review": "Best Atelier game yet. Has the great duo of Sophie and Plachta with all of the quality of life improvements of the later \"Mysterious\" Games and the graphics of Ryza. Perfect for a comfy grindy rpg afternoon.\n\nThe main story, never really the strength of these games, is still somewhat lacking but is more interesting and gripping than any of the Atelier games I've played. \nWe still get the variety of characters and the mini interaction cutscenes with them as we get to know them more.\nCombat is a bit like Lydie and Suelle but more refined. 3 people in battle and 3 in support with skills allowing you to swap them more or less at will.\nCrafting is the Tetris style \"fit all your materials in the pot\" of past Mysterious games with \"Links\" being the mechanic to increase max effects. Can be very in depth if you want it to be. The trait transfer and combination system works just like the previous games.\n\nMy only real critique so far is the weather system. Although I like the idea of changing the areas to allow different places to be explored, the items to do it have to be recharged between uses. The items hold 20 charges each... but you end up changing the weather A LOT and it can be a hassle having to stop and go back to refill. That and weather can be changed in battle which feels a little shallow and more of a binary \"Either the enemy is buffed or debuffed\" system.

It basically meshes the better aspects of Atelier Sophie with some good aspects from Ryza and Ryza 2, and the end result is great.\n\nThe synthesis system is very similar to Atelier Sophie on the surface, but the few changes have a big impact. Sophie system was very good, this one also is. Might be my favorite crafting system yet.\n\nThe combat system feels like a good upgrade, especially with how it deals with stacking buffs and debuffs, and I think is my favorite turn-based combat in the series so far (I haven't played Lulua yet to compare it with that one, though). I particularly really like that it makes you use your \"reserve characters\" as well, I always appreciate combat systems that do that - makes you care and equip your whole party instead of picking just one single team.\n\nThe \"Very Hard\" difficulty is once again decent enough that it can be enjoyable, not being the snore-fest that it was on Ryza 2, though I still think they should just let us pick Charismatic right out of the start instead of locking it behind a game clear.\n\nThe only issues I have so far is with port quality; it carries the same issues that Ryza 2 has. Stuttering, frame drops, and restricted keybindings for keyboard to the point that I prefer playing with a controller.", "positive": true}, {"review": "Good Game with Good Pain.....", "positive": true}, {"review": "My initial expectation was something along the lines of A20/Lulua, where the effort, budget, and creative energy felt very scaled back from the more traditional mainline releases like the Mysterious trilogy games. I'm not very far in yet but I have done my research and been in this business for over a decade now. \n\nMusic is definitely scaled back, with a return to VSTs from the mostly live instruments of Ryza 2, and with the entire tracklist being loaded onto two familiar series regulars (except one track by the ACRYLICSTAB guy and the opening vocal song by our beloved Yano). However, it's perfectly fine as comfort food and Yanagawa is such a monster he still has lots of pleasant surprises spread throughout.\n\nBy virtue of being so much more recent than earlier games like the original Sophie, most of the graphics look super good. I can't get over how good Sophie looks now in 2022. However, I don't think I can get anti-aliasing to work with this game. The borders of character models look extremely rough except from a comfortable distance (then they get a warm glow and the issue vanishes). I'm extremely used to this after so many games, if anyone has a magic solution to it that'd be neat though. The movies drag REALLY hard for me, will check a few settings but for now I am just overlooking the issue since I can view them outside of the game anyway and they're mostly extraneous flavour. \n\nThe grid alchemy from the rest of the Mysterious trilogy makes a return. Personally, I'm a HUGE fan of it. Ryza's node system felt a little too straightforward particularly in the lategame while earlier series didn't have much room for \"active alchemy\", mostly relying on just tossing traits back and forth in long strings. The little grid puzzles are fun in seeing what you can squeeze out with some obscure materials. I liked the combat in A19 so much and I have yet to delve into it enough to make much judgment on how the lategame parties shape up, but I am optimistic. \n\nVery solid release so far, just recognize it's not the same scale of product as Ryza 2 or Lydie & Suelle.

To be honest I didn't really know what to expect, but unfortunately the first half hour of the game was enough to tell me this just isn't for me. I just really dislike how slow-paced the game is. Firstly your character is as slow as molasses relative to how large the environments are. I suspected something was off when I saw they were actually selling running speed as DLC (no joke, look at the Digital Deluxe version features), and as it turns out your base speed being obscenely slow is simply due to malevolence rather than incompetence. But that's not all. Characters will talk endlessly and say so little--60% of every conversation can be safely ignored. I'm fine with slice of life but that should come with interesting characters with interesting things to say--this game rides so hard on its moe aesthetic that I guess it's just supposed to make up for the bland dialogue and characters. Yeah the girls are cute but how long can I be expected to endure their one-note innocent kawaii 10-year-old shtick and not get a little tired of it? And would it kill them to include honorifics in the translations? If you're not going to have an English dub, just go all the way and keep the translations literal. The more dissonance between what the characters say vs. what the translations say, the less immersed I am and the less I can transpose the character's Japanese voice to the English words on the screen in my head.\n\nOk now moving on to the graphics--they're not very good. The game looks like a PS3 game. I wasn't expecting a masterpiece but if you're selling the game for $60, it should look nice right? It's actually really jarring because, while the lighting system looks fairly modern, the geometry and textures are easily from 10 years ago if not more. Anyways I'm half an hour in and experienced no gameplay, and I figure I won't even really be in the gameplay loop until 5-6 hours into the game, at which point it's too late to refund. Sorry but I'm not taking that chance. This one is probably best left for the fans. Any newcomers who are interested in buying this game--even if the gameplay seems appealing, you will have to deal with an RPG that is slow in pacing and generally uninteresting. If you're ok trading substance for saccharine character interactions, i.e. you just want to turn your brain off, this might be worth checking out. \n\nSo what's the takeaway? Am I stamping my feet, demanding the next entry in this series to cater more to me? No. Who am I to come into a niche series with an existing fanbase and say it should change? It shouldn't. It's just not for me, and I'm happy for Atelier fans who get to celebrate another entry in their franchise. I just think it's good for prospective buyers to get an opinion from someone who was new to the series who did not like it. I think most should steer clear, maybe steer clear of Koei Tecmo as a whole as they seem more than content to fleece their customer base (seriously--there's the Atlus tax, then there's these guys).", "positive": false}, {"review": "Yes Iam buying this because SOPHIE ! ! !", "positive": true}, {"review": "Man, the new system makes me fall in love once more on Sophie series!", "positive": true}, {"review": "Great addition to the series, One of the synthisis I liked the most was Sophie one because it required some thinking about how and when to put certain items into the recipe in order to squeeze the best results out, but it also took a lot of time because of how important item order was to where you could spend a long time trying to figure out how to get two different things to the next threshold. This new synthesis (of what I have unlocked so far, none of the advanced stuff yet) keeps the puzzle aspect but does it in a way to respect the players time a bit more. The item refreshing took a middle ground between the more punishing when it is gone it is gone and the too easy of return home and it gets fully recovered and added a cost to recovering items charges, so somewhere right in the middle of the two extremes making gold actually useful something I never really used in other games since I always crafted my stuff. Now to the more unique part of this entree since Synthesis and item counts are basically tweaks half way between Sophie and newer games.The changing level mechanic, it is an interesting way to add a lot more maps without adding a lot more maps, I am not totally sold on it yet but it does add a level of puzzle design to the levels.

The bulk of this is likely due to the new UI, which makes it much easier to identify ingredients, elements, etc. Whatever the case, I found myself really getting into it, trying to get the perfect ingredient spread to fill up all the spaces without overlapping, rotating the pieces just right to get the maximum number of links, and really just trying to min-max my way to some stupidly powerful items.\n\nHonestly, it might be the best I\u2019ve seen in the series yet and this is coming from someone that has played nine entries.\n\n[h2]Gathering & Game World[/h2]\nTaking cues from Ryza, the game world is now this big, inter-connected thing. It\u2019s not necessarily open world, but each area is large enough on its own that it kinda gives that impression. It\u2019s not one of those \u201cempty\u201d open worlds though. There\u2019s hills, forests, caves, ruins, and these are all flooded with enemies, items, treasure, and other stuff to find.\n\nIngredients are actually visible on the map this time and the combat now takes place without any loading screens. The game may have dropped some of the additional exploration tools introduced in the last Ryza game, but in its place introduced a new weather system.\n\nThe weather system was pretty cool at first, but I can\u2019t deny that I became a bit iffy on it as the game went on. Having to cycle around the different weather settings to get to where I needed to go can be a bit tedious and it doesn\u2019t help that the weather items have a set number of uses before being depleted.\n\nThe game does provide waypoints on the map that can be traveled to once activated, so it is not as annoying once you\u2019ve explored an area, but I would say this new addition is okay at best.\n\n[h2]Graphics[/h2]\nCompared to some other genres it might not be the best, but for an Atelier game the graphics are absolutely some good stuff and comparable to the quality we got in the past two Ryza games. Actual level geometry, buildings that aren\u2019t just giant blocks, and the character models are noticeably more crisp. Great news, as Sophie might just be my favorite Atelier protagonist design-wise.\n\n[h2]Combat[/h2]\nCombat is yet again another area of improvement and it feels really nice to finally get back to the tried and true turn-based formula of past Atelier games. For one, it\u2019s fast-paced. Because entering combat requires no loading screens, you\u2019re thrown right into it and can immediately start duking it out. Animations can be sped up to 2x and that was pretty much the default for me. The animations are already fast enough, but keeping it at 2x makes battles go significantly faster and you can easily get the materials you need from certain monsters within a matter of seconds.\n\nAnd if you do want to take it slow, there is a good bit of depth here. Twin actions, type matchups, skills, abilities, changing the weather mid-battle, and of course, all of the different items that can be crafted and then used in battle. It doesn\u2019t go too out there in terms of complexity, but it\u2019s not this dead simple thing either.\n\n[h2]Game Loop[/h2]\nIn the first Sophie, it felt like I was constantly doing the same basic process over and over - unlocking a new recipe, crafting it, then having to hunt down the next recipe to craft and so on. There was little actual story content until the end and a lot of the time I was doing guesswork trying to figure out which NPC, item, area, or whatever triggered the next recipe idea to allow me to progress.\n\nSophie 2 pretty much does away with this system entirely. Recipe ideas are still there and get triggered as you do stuff, but I hardly ever found myself locked behind some mystery gate for hours trying to figure out what to do. Instructions are not as vague, relevant NPCs, items, and monsters are marked on the map, and the game in general doesn\u2019t waste your time grinding out recipes.\n\n[h2]Story[/h2]\nThe story this time is actually NOT terrible. Not only is the writing better, but the plot is weaved in and out of the gameplay in a manner that doesn\u2019t require it to all be dropped at the end to wrap up in the time remaining. From the start you are constantly getting new cutscenes, character backgrounds, story events - the entire slate. There is much more dialogue this time around, but I also found it to be more interesting.\n\nI won\u2019t sit here and tell you that it\u2019s the best around - I mean, Atelier games generally aren't known for their writing - but it was engaging enough that it didn\u2019t feel like an interruption to the otherwise excellent gameplay.\n\n[h2]PC Port[/h2]\nRunning at max settings, 1440p and 144 fps on my 3080 Ti was fine and I didn\u2019t have any stability issues there, but the UI has this weird bug (I assume it is a bug) where whenever certain menus open or close, the game dips to 30 fps for a split second, resulting in a visible slowdown.\n\nThis is best demonstrated when opening a recipe for crafting or opening your storage container to view ingredients. Doing so immediately dips the fps before climbing back up again once the menu is visible. However, I also noticed the issue when gathering items on the map. When doing so, items are listed on the left side of the screen for a few seconds before disappearing and, unfortunately, when they do vanish from the screen, the game microstutters.\n\nOtherwise, the PC port is fine. Runs well, no crashes, and even has a good amount of settings to change - at least for a Koei Tecmo port. Controls on a controller are flawless, but the keyboard and mouse controls were practically unplayable for me. There is no mouse cursor for menus, the mouse is not locked to the game window when controlling the camera, and it jitters constantly. This is definitely not a game I would recommend if you do not have a controller to play it with.\n\n[h2]Overall[/h2]\nAtelier Sophie 2 is the best in the series yet, combining the elements that made the first Sophie fun with the recent advancements in Ryza to deliver a familiar, yet modernized Atelier experience. In-depth crafting, fun turn-based combat, great graphics and music, a story that is actually not terrible - there\u2019s a lot of good to say about this game even if it may have a few technical flaws and some iffy elements. For newcomers, it still might be best to start with Ryza, but Sophie 2 is an easy next best choice.\n\nFollow my [b][url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/3215371]Steam Curator Page[/url][/b] for more reviews + videos!!", "positive": true}]
